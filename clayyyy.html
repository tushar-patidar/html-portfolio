<h4>Clay Soil
    Among the other types of soils, clay soil consists of the smallest particles that are tightly packed. There can be very little to no air space between the particles. Clay is also defined as a fine-grained cohesive soil and has the finest particles among all other soil kinds. Due to tiny size particles, it has a tight hold on large quantities of nutrients and water. Because of its small particles, clay tends to settle itself. However, it allows only a small amount of air and moisture to pass through the spaces between particles.
    
    Generally, clay soil feels cold, and it takes time to get warmed. It is because the water stored between particles also has to warm up. Besides, this type of soil can get too hard when it gets dry, especially in the summer. It becomes too difficult for the air and moisture to penetrate through its particles in such a case. This eventually makes clay soil tough for gardening. However, compost or mulch can be included in the soil to prevent certain soil freezing, making it ideal for planting. Apart from this, clay usually expands when it comes to contact with the water and shrinks when dry.</h4>
