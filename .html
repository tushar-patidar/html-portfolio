<h4>Silt Soil
    Silt soil or silty soil is composed of much smaller particles as compared to sandy soil. It is usually formed due to the composition of mud, clay, or small rocks deposited by a river or a lake. This type of soil is mostly seen nearest the river and lake. When moistened, the silt soil becomes a soapy slick. Also, if we roll it between our fingers, it generally leaves dirt particles on our skin.
    
    Apart from this, silt soil is very smooth and can hold water comparatively better than sandy soil. However, Silt soil lacks nutrients compared to other types of soil. That is why it is known as fairly fertile. Silt soil is used in most farming practices to improve soil fertility. Because of its properties, the soil can easily be compacted by heavy overlying materials. Therefore, we need to be cautious while gardening; otherwise, it may get aerated poorly.</h4>
