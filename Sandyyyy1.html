    Sandy Soil
Among all the different types of soil, sandy soil is known as the poorest type of soil. It consists of the largest soil particles, which can be seen with the naked eye. Because it is composed of the largest particles having huge gaps between them, it cannot hold on to water. This ultimately makes it tough for the plants' roots to absorb water. Besides, it has low nutrients. Therefore, plants don't get the proper nutrients and water in sandy soils because they are quickly carried away by the runoff. However, the sandy soil is considered good for the drainage system.

This type of soil is usually formed by the breakage or fragmentation of rock grain materials such as limestone, granite and quartz.
